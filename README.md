# doppler ðŸ”Š

Small visualization of doppler sound effect for Physics 1.

## Controls

```(SPEED SLIDER)``` - Set the velocity magnitude of the source to a certain Mach number when in motion.

```(ARROW BUTTONS)``` - Change the velocity of the source in one of four directions *(the observer is stationary)*.

```(STOP BUTTON)``` - Set the velocity magnitude of the source to zero which results in matching source and observer frequencies.

## Output

The hue of the source represents the mapped frequency of the sound wave sent with respect to the source.

The hue of the observer represents the mapped frequency of the sound wave received with respect to the observer at the time of arrival.

The greater the hue number, the higher frequency of the sound wave relative to the source or observer.
