# doppler

Small realtime web simulation of the doppler effect for sound waves.

## About

Doppler effect simulation particularized in the context of sound waves and where a wave emitting source and wave detecting observer move with a user controllable velocity or acceleration.

## Source

Source is controllable in velocity or acceleration and can be in one of three states which are stationary, constant velocity or constant acceleration. Source emits waves with a constant frequency and amplitude.

## Observer

Observer, similarly, is controllable in velocity or acceleration and can be in one of three states which are stationary, constant velocity or constant acceleration. Observer detects one wave at a time and records their perceived frequency and amplitude (hyperlink).

## Waves

Waves propagate in time with their amplitude attenuate exponentially. Only the crest of the waves are illustrated in the simulation. Currently when multiple waves collide, interference is not accounted for.

## Limitations

Does not implement the effects of wave interference.

Observer can only detect one frequency and amplitude at a timeo
